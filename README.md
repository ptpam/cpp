# C++ Programming Study - Stroustrup's Book

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to studying and implementing "The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup (2013 Edition), chapter by chapter. Each chapter's key concepts are explored and implemented in C++ code examples.

## Objective
The primary objective of this repository is to deepen understanding of C++ through practical coding examples based on the chapters of the book. This will include exercises, examples, and personal implementations of the concepts discussed by Stroustrup.

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a chapter in the book:
- `chap02-basics/`
- `chap3-abstraction/`
- ... and so forth.

Inside each chapter's folder, you'll find:
- `README.md` - Summary of the chapter and key concepts.
- Source files containing C++ code implementations of the exercises and examples discussed.

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to each chapter to see the implementations and chapter summaries.
- Compile and run the C++ files to see the concepts in action.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests. You can also open issues for discussions or suggestions for improvements.
